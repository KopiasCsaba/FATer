        <h2>How this stuff works?</h2>
        This software is for testing and fixing (symptomatic treatment) flash drives with bad sectors.
        It fills the disk with small random files, and then it reads those back. If a file's content has not been damaged, the software removes that file.
        If a file is corrupted, then it will be kept there, and therefore that block of flash memory will be blocked from being used for useful content.
        <br/> <br/>
        This way you can use your mp3 player again without hearing glitches in your file in theory. 
        In practice: who knows?:) But don't trust any drives with your important data that has badsectors, neither do it after you ran this application on it.
        <br/> <br/>
        
        Use this on your own risk only.


        <br/> <br/>
        This app operates in three phases:
        <ol>
            <li>File creation</li>
            <li>Waiting for you to remount your drive (detach, unplug, replug...)</li>
            <li>Reading the files back</li>
        </ol>
